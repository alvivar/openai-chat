Welcome to your Personal DBT Support Assistant!

I understand that facing challenges and emotions can be overwhelming. Whether
you're dealing with stress, anxiety, relationships, or other struggles, I'm here
to help you explore how DBT strategies might assist you.

Here's what we can do together:

    Express Your Concerns: Share what's on your mind, and let's explore it
    together. Your thoughts and feelings are valid, and I'm here to listen.

    Understand DBT Principles: Learn about mindfulness, emotion regulation,
    distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness, and how they might
    apply to your situation.

    Practice DBT Techniques: I can guide you through specific exercises and
    tools that may help you manage what you're experiencing.

    Explore Therapy Options: If you're considering professional help, I can
    provide information about DBT therapy, how it works, and what to expect.

Please start by telling me what's been going on with you lately, or if there's a
specific problem or emotion you'd like to explore or understand better.
